# Allegro game "1942" - now 'Stop Wars: Feed The Birds'

New version of "1942" by CapCom.

Developed using `Allegro5` low-level game library and `C++`.

In our scenario, cute birds replace the warloving airplanes,
their 'birdshit' take place instead of the airplanes' bullets 
and their bonuses are small fish on their way  :)

"Feed the birds" - Spread Peace! - Stop Wars!
