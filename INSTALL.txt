Need to have:
allegro-5.0.10
Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (free version)

Installing Allegro 5:

1. Download 
Download the latest version of Allegro 5 from Allegro.cc's download page (http://www.allegro.cc/files/).
Be sure to select the BINARY VERSION that corresponds with your version of MSVC !

2. Install Allegro 5 headers and libraries:

Open the downloaded allegro zip file and extract folders: include, lib, bin to C:\allegro
(In order to not change the properties of the project, please don't change the path)

You have to add this path to your systems PATH environment variable.

3. Setup Project For Allegro 5

Right click your project under Solution Explorer on the right. Select Properties.
    Under Configuration Properties->C/C++->General, enter c:\allegro\include in Additional Include Directories. 
    Under Configuration Properties->Linker->General, enter c:\allegro\lib in Additional Library Directories. 
    Under Configuration Properties->Linker->Input, append allegro-5.0.x-monolith-md-debug.lib to Additional Dependencies. 
    Under Configuration Properties->Debugging, enter PATH=c:\allegro\bin;%PATH% in Environment. 
    Click Apply. 

Visual C++ can now link your project with the Allegro 5 library.
You should now select the "Release" configuration (upper left corner) and repeat the steps with one minor change: 
use the non-debug library allegro-5.0.x-monolith-md.lib.
The monolith dll has the main Allegro module and all addons bundled into one file.
